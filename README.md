HR analytics with RFM segmentation

I'm using dataset from here https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vjchoudhary7/hr-analytics-case-study

## Project Overview

This project presents a fully interactive HR Analytics Dashboard built using Power BI Desktop.
It transforms raw HR data into actionable insights, focusing on:
